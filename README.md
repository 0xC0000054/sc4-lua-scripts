# SimCity 4 Deluxe Lua Scripts

This repository contains all of the Lua scripts in SimCity_1.dat.
The scripts have been extracted and renamed back to their original names using [sc4-lua-file-hash](https://github.com/0xC0000054/sc4-lua-file-hash).

SimCity 4 used Lua scripts for the advisors, automata, rewards, tutorials, etc.

This repository is intended as a reference for SimCity 4 mod authors that makes it
easier to explore the scripts.
